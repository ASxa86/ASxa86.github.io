I am a software engineer with over 7 years of professional C++ experience. I graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering from Wright State University.

I work as the lead developer for a small team of modeling and simulation engineers. My team and I develop a high performance integration framework capable of running multiple integrations at varying frequencies all in real time while providing data analysis and 3D OpenGL visualization.

In my free time I can be found here writing blog posts and developing already solved problems for my game engine.

# Why I created this blog

I created this blog to share my own knowledge and experience to inform anyone who may find interest in software engineering. It is also a place to show off and learn new technologies and design patterns I may not get a chance to use in my day-to-day work.
